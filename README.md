## Project Description

The voice recognition project with machine learning techniques aims to develop a simple video game that responds to voice commands. The project is divided into two main parts: the first part focuses on implementing a conventional classifier to recognize specific words, while the second part utilizes a convolutional neural network to enhance the accuracy of voice recognition.

Over a span of five weeks, the students worked in teams to create the necessary modules to extract audio features and build a database with the target words for recognition. The approach focuses on both traditional techniques and deep learning techniques to extract more advanced audio features.

The final outcome of the project is an "intelligent" classifier capable of recognizing and classifying specific words ("Empezar", "Girar", "Leprechaun", "Mas", "Menos"), enabling users to interact with a video game using voice commands. This provides an interactive and enjoyable experience, combining signal processing, audio techniques, and machine learning. 

These words were spoken in the Spanish language, for specific reasons related to the course.
